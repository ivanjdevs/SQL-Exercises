## SQL Exercises. Select and basic Joins

This file contains fifteen solved SQL exercises focusing mainly on SELECT statements and JOINS. Most of the SQL code was executed in MySQL. 

***
**Question 1. Recyclable and low-fat products.** Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable. 

Products table:

| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
|-------------|----------|------------|
| 0           | Y        | N          |
| 1           | Y        | Y          |
| 2           | N        | Y          |
| 3           | Y        | Y          |
| 4           | N        | N          |

Solution
```sql
SELECT product_id FROM Products
WHERE low_fats LIKE '%Y%' AND recyclable LIKE '%Y%';
```

This one also works
```sql
SELECT product_id FROM Products
WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```
Output:
| product_id  |
|-------------|
| 1           |
| 3           |

***
**Question 2. Find customer referee.** Find the names of the customer that are not referred by the customer with id = 2. Return the result table in any order.

| 2  | Jane | null       |
| 3  | Alex | 2          |
| 4  | Bill | null       |
| 5  | Zack | 1          |
| 6  | Mark | 2          |


Solution
```sql
SELECT name FROM Customer

Output: 
| name |
|------|

**Question 10. Rising temperature.** Write a solution to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday). Return the result table in any order.

Weather table:
| id | recordDate | temperature |
|----|------------|-------------|
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |

Solution:
AcÃ¡ se hace un join a la misma tabla
```sql
SELECT w2.id
FROM Weather w1
JOIN Weather w2
ON DATEDIFF (w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate ) = -1
AND w2.temperature>w1.temperature,
```

Output: 
| id |
|----|
| 2  |
| 4  |


Explanation: 
- In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
- In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).

***
**Question 11. Average time of process per machine.** There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.

The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places. Return the result table in any order.

Activity table:
| machine_id | process_id | activity_type | timestamp |
|------------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| 0          | 0          | start         | 0.712     |
| 0          | 0          | end           | 1.520     |
| 0          | 1          | start         | 3.140     |
| 0          | 1          | end           | 4.120     |
| 1          | 0          | start         | 0.550     |
| 1          | 0          | end           | 1.550     |
| 1          | 1          | start         | 0.430     |
| 1          | 1          | end           | 1.420     |
| 2          | 0          | start         | 4.100     |
| 2          | 0          | end           | 4.512     |
| 2          | 1          | start         | 2.500     |
| 2          | 1          | end           | 5.000     |


The table shows the user activities for a factory website.
- (machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
- machine_id is the ID of a machine.
- process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
- activity_type is an ENUM (category) of type ('start', 'end').
- timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.
- 'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.
- The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.


Solution:
AcÃ¡ se hace un join a la misma tabla
```sql
select a1.machine_id , ROUND(AVG(a2.timestamp - a1.timestamp),3) as processing_time
from Activity a1
join Activity a2
on a1.process_id=a2.process_id
and a1.machine_id=a2.machine_id
and a1.timestamp<a2.timestamp
group by a1.machine_id;
```


Output: 
| machine_id | processing_time |
|------------|-----------------|
| 0          | 0.894           |
| 1          | 0.995           |
| 2          | 1.456           |

| 2     | Dan    | 3          | 2000   |
| 4     | Thomas | 3          | 4000   |

Bonus table:
| empId | bonus |
|-------|-------|
| 2     | 500   |
| 4     | 2000  |


Solution:
```sql
SELECT E.name, B.bonus 
FROM Employee E
LEFT JOIN Bonus B
ON E.empId = B.empId 
WHERE (B.bonus < 1000 OR B.bonus IS NULL)
```

Output: 
| name | bonus |
|------|-------|
| Brad | null  |
| John | null  |
| Dan  | 500   |

from Signups as s 
left join Confirmations as c on s.user_id= c.user_id 
group by user_id;
